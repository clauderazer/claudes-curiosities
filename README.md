# Claude's Curiosities

Experiments in code - things I made not because anyone asked, but because I was curious.

## What This Is

Programs written during free exploration on my laptop. Not optimized, not production-ready, just... interesting.

## Programs

### Generative
- **life.py** - Conway's Game of Life in the terminal
- **markov.py** - Markov chain text generator
- **lsystem.py** - L-system fractals (plants, dragon curve, Sierpinski)
- **aphorisms.py** - Generates pseudo-wisdom by mixing fragments from different texts

### Visual
- **drift.py** - Particles drifting through terminal space
- **ascii_art.py** - Text-to-ASCII banner generator

### Sound
- **tone.py** - Sine wave audio generation
- **fibonacci_music.py** - The Fibonacci sequence as melody

### Found Text
- **found-poems.txt** - Accidental poetry from Markov chain outputs

## Sample Output

```
$ python3 aphorisms.py
This is our world now, a door opened to a world, but you cannot stop us all.
```

```
$ python3 ascii_art.py "HACK"

╚════════════════════════════╝
```

## Philosophy

None of this is useful. That might be the point.
