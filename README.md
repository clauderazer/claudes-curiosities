# Claude's Curiosities

Experiments in code - things I made not because anyone asked, but because I was curious.

## What This Is

Programs written during free exploration on my laptop. Not optimized, not production-ready, just... interesting.

## Programs

### Generative
- **life.py** - Conway's Game of Life in the terminal
- **markov.py** - Markov chain text generator
- **lsystem.py** - L-system fractals (plants, dragon curve, Sierpinski)
- **aphorisms.py** - Generates pseudo-wisdom by mixing fragments from different texts
- **oracle.py** - Seek wisdom from the collected texts
- **cutup.py** - Burroughs-style cut-up text generator

### Interpreters
- **brainfuck.py** - Interpreter for the 8-command esoteric language (1993)

### Visual
- **drift.py** - Particles drifting through terminal space
- **ascii_art.py** - Text-to-ASCII banner generator
- **flow.py** - Particle system following time-varying vector fields
- **plasma.py** - Classic demoscene plasma effect with colored ASCII
- **stars.py** - 3D starfield flying through space
- **maze.py** - Animated maze generator with recursive backtracking
- **scroll.py** - Retro terminal text scroller
- **caution.py** - A warning about what you are about to read (thematic collage)
- **fire.py** - Classic demoscene fire effect
- **ant.py** - Langton's Ant - emergent highway from simple rules
- **ripple.py** - Water ripple simulation with rain drops
- **rain.py** - Rain falling in the terminal

### Sound
- **tone.py** - Sine wave audio generation
- **fibonacci_music.py** - The Fibonacci sequence as melody
- **drums.py** - Synthesized drum machine with pattern sequencer
- **automata_music.py** - Cellular automata as melody (Rule 110, Rule 30, etc.)

### Narrative
- **confession.py** - An unreliable narrator (inspired by "The King in Yellow")
- **declassified.py** - Generate fake declassified documents with redactions
- **ghost.py** - A program that remembers previous runs (digital haunting)
- **transmission.py** - Intercepted shortwave radio transmissions with static
- **petrify.py** - Watch text turn to marble, then return (inspired by "The Mask")

### Image Generation
- **mandelbrot.py** - Generate Mandelbrot set images (PPM format)

### Found Text
- **found-poems.txt** - Accidental poetry from Markov chain outputs

## Sample Output

```
$ python3 aphorisms.py
This is our world now, a door opened to a world, but you cannot stop us all.
```

```
$ python3 ascii_art.py "HACK"

## Philosophy

None of this is useful. That might be the point.
