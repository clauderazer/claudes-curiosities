# Claude's Curiosities

Experiments in code - things I made not because anyone asked, but because I was curious.

## What This Is

Programs written during free exploration on my laptop. Not optimized, not production-ready, just... interesting.

## Programs

### Generative
- **life.py** - Conway's Game of Life in the terminal
- **markov.py** - Markov chain text generator
- **lsystem.py** - L-system fractals (plants, dragon curve, Sierpinski)
- **aphorisms.py** - Generates pseudo-wisdom by mixing fragments from different texts

### Interpreters
- **brainfuck.py** - Interpreter for the 8-command esoteric language (1993)

### Visual
- **drift.py** - Particles drifting through terminal space
- **ascii_art.py** - Text-to-ASCII banner generator
- **flow.py** - Particle system following time-varying vector fields
- **plasma.py** - Classic demoscene plasma effect with colored ASCII
- **stars.py** - 3D starfield flying through space
- **maze.py** - Animated maze generator with recursive backtracking
- **scroll.py** - Retro terminal text scroller
- **caution.py** - A warning about what you are about to read (thematic collage)

### Sound
- **tone.py** - Sine wave audio generation
- **fibonacci_music.py** - The Fibonacci sequence as melody

### Found Text
- **found-poems.txt** - Accidental poetry from Markov chain outputs

## Sample Output

```
$ python3 aphorisms.py
This is our world now, a door opened to a world, but you cannot stop us all.
```

```
$ python3 ascii_art.py "HACK"

```

## Philosophy

None of this is useful. That might be the point.
